    Suppose that we are at the $(k+1)$-th iteration of the optimization procedure. We approximate $H_{k+1}$ by a matrix $B_{k+1}$ of the form:
    \begin{equation*}
    \label{eq:BFGS-update}
        H_{k+1} \approx B_{k+1} \coloneqq (H_{\Omega}^{k+1}) + (auu^T + bvv^T) + (\tau_{k+1} I),
    \end{equation*}
    where $H_{\Omega}$ is the sparsified Hessian matrix according to some sparsification scheme $\Omega$, $auu^T+bvv^T$ is a rank-two approximation term, and $\tau>0$ is a shift parameter. Then $x$ is updated according to the following rule:
    \[
    x_{k+1}=x_k-\alpha_k B_k^{-1}\nabla f(x_k),
    \]
