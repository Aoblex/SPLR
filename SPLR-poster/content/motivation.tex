    The main idea of SPLR is to provide an \emph{accurate approximation} of the Hessian matrix while maintaining its \emph{sparsity} as much as possible:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{\color{sufered} Sparse:} Some second-order methods have been proposed based on the idea of Hessian sparsification. SPLR also obtain an approximation of the true Hessian matrix by sparsification.
        \item \textbf{\color{sufered} Low-Rank:} Similar to the BFGS update rule, we incorporate a low-rank correction term to enhance the approximation quality.
    \end{itemize}
