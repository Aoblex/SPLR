    Our main contributions are summarized as follows:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item New theoretical results are developed to understand Hessian sparsification.
        \item A new quasi-Newton method is proposed to solve entropic-regularized OT with \emph{super-linear-like} convergence speed in practice.
        \item We provide convergence guarantees for the proposed method: SPLR enjoys a \emph{global convergence} property and the convergence speed is at least \emph{linear}.
        \item We conduct extensive numerical experiments to demonstrate the performance of SPLR on various entropic-regularized OT problems.
    \end{itemize}
